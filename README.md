 EverWeb conversion files

1. Make sure all galleries are in the highest quality. In iWeb, select album > Inspector > Photos Inspector > Photos > Photo Download Size > Original.
2. Publish the website to folder.
3. Place the .py script file inside that folder, anywhere in the root (not in the Media folders!). 
4. Run the script.

Expected result: all Media folders in the published website should contain photos, not photo folders.
